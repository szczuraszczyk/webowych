        <p class="text-in-a-box">It all started probably when ROUND 6 of Alien Stage came out and everyone in the alnst fandom were all over the place. I saw a lot of TikToks of the mentioned round, being spoilered who won in it while not knowing who those characters even were. All the sad edits were pretty cool and all, and I thought to myself that maybe I should watch it. Well, it happened only when ROUND 7 came out that I finally decided to get into the show. And I promise you, if you are not mentally okay do not touch this series because it is very emotional. But! I honestly started watching it for Till not Ivan, but I wasn't able to get away from liking yet another queer character. So here I am now, fangirling over a fictional man that, mind you, is not so simple as he looks. THIS MAN IS STUPID. I HATE HIM. EAT HIM EW EW GO AWAY.</p>
        <p class="bigger emphasis">why is it my hobby?</p>
        <ul class="styled-list">
            <li>It isn't my hobby that sounds insane. to have a hobby where you stare at a 2D man who wouldn't bother looking back if he was real. GET A JOB, GET A LIFE.</li>
            <li>OK BUT HAVE YOU HEARD HIS VOICE? <span class="highlight">PARK BYEONG HOON</span> ATE</li>
            <li>I honestly hate Ivan. 
                <ul>
                    <li>his face</li>
                    <li>his voice</li>
                    <li>his hands</li>
                    <li>his character</li>
                    <li>the fact bro is NOT innocent when it comes to his crush like chill</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>anyway he's a pathetic moron</li>
        </ul>
