        <p>My hobby is doing something related to Ivan at least once a day. Looking at his fanarts, listening to his songs or songs of his voice actor. Just appreciating the man's beauty. WHO DOESN'T.
            <br><br>
            I also hope the fact the hobby is not a hobby at all won't affect my grade........ if it will please tell me i'll change it. I thought it will be fun, that's all! Just please pretend it's about music, listening to music is my hobby! Or about watching anime! Appreciating animations and the art!
